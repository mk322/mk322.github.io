Hello! I am a CS Ph.D. Student at University of California San Diego (UCSD). I am fortunate to be advised by [Lianhui Qin](https://sites.google.com/view/lianhuiqin/home). I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree from the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science at the University of Washington (UW), Seattle](https://www.cs.washington.edu/). During my undergraduate time, I was forunated to work closely with [Luke Zettlemoyer](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/lsz) and [Terra Blevins](https://blvns.github.io/), who provided invaluable mentorship and guidance in my early research endeavors. 

[comment]: <> (-After completing my undergraduate studies, I w a research internship in the [Huaxiu Yao](https://www.huaxiuyao.io/)'s research lab at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and I was working as a Research Assistant under the supervision of [Xiao-Yang Liu](https://openfin.engineering.columbia.edu/people/xiao-yang-yanglet-liu) at Columbia University.)

**I am interested in securing a summer research internship in the industry.** If you know of any relevant openings or could provide an introduction, I would deeply appreciate your support.

Research Interests
======
My research focuses on *Machine Reasoning* in Large ML Models, including Large Language Models, Vision/Multimodal Language Models, and World Models. I am particularly interested in enhancing their reasoning and planning abilities to enable more robust problem-solving. I explore how these models can be utilized by separating the world model, which simulates the world, from the inference model, which takes actions coupled with a world model. Ultimately, I aim to solve practical real-world tasks with these large models, such as embodied AI and robotics.

[comment]: <> (- Multilingual NLP: With the digital world erasing geographical boundaries, I believe in the power of multilingual NLP to bridge communication gaps. I'm working on models that can understand and process multiple languages, bringing down linguistic barriers in information access.)

As I continue this exciting journey in research, I am always eager to collaborate, share insights, and learn from others in this dynamic field. Feel free to reach out to me for collaborations, discussions, or even a casual chat about research!
